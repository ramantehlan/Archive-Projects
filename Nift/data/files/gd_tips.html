<p>A group discussion (GD) is a simulated exercise, where you cannot suddenly put up a show, since the evaluators will see through you easily. In this page you can find tips on GD and how to handle them to ensure a positive outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s how most group discussions work</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Normally groups of 8-10 candidates are formed into a leaderless group, and are given a specific situation to analyze and discuss within a given time limit.</li>
<li>The group may be given a case study and asked to come out with a solution for a problem.<a href="http://pahaldesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/slide11.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5333" alt="slide11" src="http://pahaldesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/slide11.jpg" width="960" height="400" /></a></li>
<li>The group may be given a topic and asked to discuss on the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>A panel will observe the proceedings and evaluate the members of the group.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">OBJECTIVE</span></strong><br />
Lets start from the basic. One needs to know what one&#8217;s objective in the group is. A good definition of your objective is &#8211; to be noticed to have contributed meaningfully in an attempt to help the group reach the right <a href="http://gdpi.ascenteducation.com/india-mba/consensus.shtml"><strong>consensus</strong></a>. What does this essentially mean?</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>The <strong>first implication</strong> is that <strong>you should be noticed </strong>by the panel. Merely making a meaningful contribution and helping the group arrive at a <a href="http://gdpi.ascenteducation.com/india-mba/consensus.shtml"><strong>consensus</strong></a>is not enough. You have to be seen by the evaluating panel to have made the meaningful contribution. What does that mean in practice?
<ul>
<li>You must ensure that the group hears you. If the group hears you, so will the evaluator. That does not mean that you shout at the top of your voice and be noticed for the wrong reasons.</li>
<li>You have to be assertive. If you are not a very assertive person, you will have to simply learn to be assertive for those 15 minutes. Remember, assertiveness does not mean being bull-headed or being arrogant.</li>
<li>And most importantly, you have to make your chances. Many group discussion participants often complain that they did not get a chance to speak. The fact is that in no group discussion will you get a chance to speak. There is nothing more unacceptable in a GD than keeping one&#8217;s mouth shut or just murmuring things which are inaudible.</li>
<li>Participate in as many practice GDs as possible before you attend the actual GD. There is nothing like practice to help you overcome the fear of talking in a GD.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>second important implication </strong>is that making just any sort of contribution is not enough. Your contribution has to be meaningful. A meaningful contribution suggests that</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<ul>
<li>You have a good <strong><a href="http://gdpi.ascenteducation.com/india-mba/group_discussion_topics/gd-pi-topics.shtml">knowledge base</a></strong></li>
<li>You are able to put forth your arguments logically and are a good communicator.</li>
<li>The quality of what you said is more valuable than the quantity. There is this myth amongst many group discussion participants that the way to succeed in a group discussion is by speaking loudly and at great length. One could not be more wrong. You must have meat in your arguments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, think things through carefully.</p>
<p>Always enter the room with a piece of paper and a pen. In the first two minutes jot down as many ideas as you can.</p>
<p><strong>When you jot down points, keep these pointers in mind.<br />
</strong>If it is a topic where you are expected to take a stand, say for example, &#8220;Should India sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty?&#8221; note down points for both sides of the argument. It will be useful on two counts -</p>
<ol start="2">
<ul>
<li>One, if you do not start the GD and are not amongst the first five speakers and find that everyone in the group is talking for the topic, then it makes sense to take the alternate approach and oppose the topic even if you initially intended to talk for the topic.</li>
<li>Second, it helps to have knowledge of how group members who take a stand diametrically opposite to yours will put forth their argument and to be prepared with counter arguments.</li>
</ul>
<li>Everybody else will state the obvious. So highlight some points that are not obvious. The different perspective that you bring to the group will be highly appreciated by the panel. Some pointers on being relevant while having a different perspective are:
<ul>
<li>Be careful that the &#8220;something different&#8221; you state is still relevant to the topic being debated.</li>
<li>Can you take the group ahead if it is stuck at one point?</li>
<li>Can you take it in a fresh and more relevant direction?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>last implicatio</strong>n is that you must be clearly seen to be attempting to build a consensus.
<ul>
<li>Gaining support or influencing colleagues is the mantra adopted by many a successful Business Leaders.</li>
<li>Nobody expects a group of ten intelligent, assertive people, all with different points of view on a controversial subject to actually achieve a consensus. But what matters is &#8220;Did you make attempts to build a consensus?&#8221;</li>
<li>The reason why an attempt to build a consensus is important is because in most work situations you will have to work with people in a team, accept joint responsibilities and take decisions as a group.</li>
<li>You must demonstrate the fact that you are capable and inclined to work as part of a team.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Objective </strong><strong>of a Group Discussion (GD)</strong></span></p>
<p>While the written exam tests the <a title="Focus on Quantitative &amp; DI for MBA" href="http://www.htcampus.com/article/cat-2011-focus-quantitative-di-709/" target="_blank">quantitative</a>, reasoning and <a title="CAT Verbal Ability …The last mile" href="http://www.htcampus.com/article/cat-verbal-ability-last-mile-161/" target="_blank">verbal</a> skills of an applicant, that’s not all that a future manager should excel in. In fact, that is just the start. A successful manager should not just be good with his quota of work, but s/he is also expected to contribute as part of a team. And, that’s what GDs aim to test.</p>
<p>GD&#8217;s are conducted to test managerial attributes like interpersonal skills, leadership, analytical and rational thinking, knowledge and personality traits.</p>
<p>It is a way through which the B-School panel measures the calibre of the candidate on parameters like content and knowledge, rational thought process, communication skills, group behaviour and leadership skills. Look at GD&#8217;s as steps up a ladder to prepare for MBA.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Types of Group Discussions</span><br />
</strong><br />
Not all GD&#8217;s are the same. B-schools use several types to test applicants. While there are some GD&#8217;s that test the knowledge of a candidate on a topical issue, others are designed to test the ‘lateral thinking’ of the candidate.</p>
<p>Another type of GD comes in the form of a short ‘case-study’ where applicants are asked to analyse a situation and frame responses. Yet another type of a GD is a ‘group exercise’.</p>
<p>GDs can be classified into three types: factual, abstract, and case study. While factual ones are based on contemporary but controversial topics, abstract topics involve lateral thinking and unconventional perspectives.</p>
<p>Topics can either be knowledge intensive or non-knowledge intensive. Knowledge-intensive topics are based on areas like the economy and its sectors like IT or telecom, society, politics, sports or media. Non-knowledge intensive topics can either be ‘concrete topics’ (like ‘greed is good’), while ‘abstract topics’ can be totally open-ended like ‘Deep Blue is not blue enough’.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>How to Prepare for a Group Discussion </strong></span></p>
<p>So, how should you prepare for the GD? Experts opine that you should work on developing your knowledge base, while at the same time focussing on improving your communication. Some specific lessons on managing yourself during the GD are important too. There are small tricks and tips that can improve your group discussion.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Tips &amp; Tricks for a Successful Group Discussion</strong><strong></strong></span></p>
<p>The first step in your quest to do well in a GD is to improve your knowledge quotient. Read, watch, listen! Read newspapers and magazines on current issues, especially year-end issues that capture highlights of the year gone by. Also, watch and listen to the news and current affair programmes on news channels. Candidates must keep abreast of contemporary issues with help of the media.</p>
<p>There are some group discussion topics of perennial interest.</p>
<p>For <a title="Economics Course" href="http://www.htcampus.com/category/banking-finance-accounting/economics/" target="_blank">economics</a>-related topics, read fundamental concepts like FDI, stock markets, liberalisation, employment scenario, capital convertibility, rupee vs dollar, inflation, export-import, socialists vs capitalists etc.</p>
<p>For sector-based topics, start by making a one-or-two page note on important sectors like <a title="IT Management" href="http://www.htcampus.com/category/mba-business-management/information-technology-management/" target="_blank">IT</a>, ITES, <a title="Banking Course India" href="http://www.htcampus.com/category/banking-finance-accounting/banking/" target="_blank">banking</a>,<a title="Insurance courses India" href="http://www.htcampus.com/category/banking-finance-accounting/insurance-actuary/" target="_blank"> insurance</a>, <a title="Retail Management" href="http://www.htcampus.com/category/mba-business-management/retail-management/" target="_blank">retail</a>, telecom, healthcare, agriculture etc. Find out about the developments in last year and prospects in the coming ones.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Express Yourself </strong><strong>During a Group Discussion</strong></span></p>
<p>Knowledge itself is not enough. The next step is to improve your ability to express yourself. You can practice speaking in a GD scenario by forming a discussion group that meets every day and take up a topic for discussion. GD or MBA discussions, as it is also known as, can be your sure shot at getting into a good B school. So, don&#8217;t take it easily. Practice ease of expression because clarity, brevity and word choice are keenly observed by evaluators.</p>
