<ul>
<li>Practice is the key to success. Try to sketch almost anything and everything you come across.<a href="img/img_e/NID-Studio-Test-2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3586" alt="NID Studio Test 2" src="img/img_e/NID-Studio-Test-2.jpg" width="448" height="252" /></a></li>
<li>Browse through various newspapers, magazines and online sites.</li>
<li>Take ideas from various advertisements, posters, banners etc., you come across.</li>
<li>Keep your eraser away from you while practicing. It’ll help your lines become more bold and confident.</li>
<li>Give importance to detailing where ever required, like the face of a human figure or the human’s outfits etc.</li>
<li>Try to master the skills of human illustration. Concentrate more in proportions, form etc.</li>
<li>Calligraphy skills come handy in posters, banner design, etc. Learn and practice different styles of lettering as they can come handy.</li>
<li>Stick to the prescribed syllabus of the NIFT entrance exam.</li>
<li>While sketching first make a light sketch and later darken the drawing once you are confident about it. This helps you save time erasing mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>In the Examination Hall:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Please use quality colour pencils. Best and economic option would be faber castle colour pencils with at least 24 shades in it.</li>
<li>Planning is very important. First plan your ideas and then start on with sketching.</li>
<li>Start off with simple ones like logo design or t-shirt design. Go for the complicated ones like scene drawing later.</li>
<li>Please!! Plan your time and try to complete the paper.</li>
</ul>

<p>A group discussion (GD) is a simulated exercise, where you cannot suddenly put up a show, since the evaluators will see through you easily. In this page you can find tips on GD and how to handle them to ensure a positive outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s how most group discussions work</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Normally groups of 8-10 candidates are formed into a leaderless group, and are given a specific situation to analyze and discuss within a given time limit.</li>
<li>The group may be given a case study and asked to come out with a solution for a problem.<a href="http://pahaldesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/slide11.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5333" alt="slide11" src="img/img_e/slide11.jpg" width="960" height="400" /></a></li>
<li>The group may be given a topic and asked to discuss on the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>A panel will observe the proceedings and evaluate the members of the group.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">OBJECTIVE</span></strong><br />
Lets start from the basic. One needs to know what one&#8217;s objective in the group is. A good definition of your objective is &#8211; to be noticed to have contributed meaningfully in an attempt to help the group reach the right <a href="http://gdpi.ascenteducation.com/india-mba/consensus.shtml"><strong>consensus</strong></a>. What does this essentially mean?</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>The <strong>first implication</strong> is that <strong>you should be noticed </strong>by the panel. Merely making a meaningful contribution and helping the group arrive at a <a href="http://gdpi.ascenteducation.com/india-mba/consensus.shtml"><strong>consensus</strong></a>is not enough. You have to be seen by the evaluating panel to have made the meaningful contribution. What does that mean in practice?
<ul>
<li>You must ensure that the group hears you. If the group hears you, so will the evaluator. That does not mean that you shout at the top of your voice and be noticed for the wrong reasons.</li>
<li>You have to be assertive. If you are not a very assertive person, you will have to simply learn to be assertive for those 15 minutes. Remember, assertiveness does not mean being bull-headed or being arrogant.</li>
<li>And most importantly, you have to make your chances. Many group discussion participants often complain that they did not get a chance to speak. The fact is that in no group discussion will you get a chance to speak. There is nothing more unacceptable in a GD than keeping one&#8217;s mouth shut or just murmuring things which are inaudible.</li>
<li>Participate in as many practice GDs as possible before you attend the actual GD. There is nothing like practice to help you overcome the fear of talking in a GD.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>second important implication </strong>is that making just any sort of contribution is not enough. Your contribution has to be meaningful. A meaningful contribution suggests that</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<ul>
<li>You have a good <strong><a href="http://gdpi.ascenteducation.com/india-mba/group_discussion_topics/gd-pi-topics.shtml">knowledge base</a></strong></li>
<li>You are able to put forth your arguments logically and are a good communicator.</li>
<li>The quality of what you said is more valuable than the quantity. There is this myth amongst many group discussion participants that the way to succeed in a group discussion is by speaking loudly and at great length. One could not be more wrong. You must have meat in your arguments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, think things through carefully.</p>
<p>Always enter the room with a piece of paper and a pen. In the first two minutes jot down as many ideas as you can.</p>
<p><strong>When you jot down points, keep these pointers in mind.<br />
</strong>If it is a topic where you are expected to take a stand, say for example, &#8220;Should India sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty?&#8221; note down points for both sides of the argument. It will be useful on two counts -</p>
<ol start="2">
<ul>
<li>One, if you do not start the GD and are not amongst the first five speakers and find that everyone in the group is talking for the topic, then it makes sense to take the alternate approach and oppose the topic even if you initially intended to talk for the topic.</li>
<li>Second, it helps to have knowledge of how group members who take a stand diametrically opposite to yours will put forth their argument and to be prepared with counter arguments.</li>
</ul>
<li>Everybody else will state the obvious. So highlight some points that are not obvious. The different perspective that you bring to the group will be highly appreciated by the panel. Some pointers on being relevant while having a different perspective are:
<ul>
<li>Be careful that the &#8220;something different&#8221; you state is still relevant to the topic being debated.</li>
<li>Can you take the group ahead if it is stuck at one point?</li>
<li>Can you take it in a fresh and more relevant direction?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>last implicatio</strong>n is that you must be clearly seen to be attempting to build a consensus.
<ul>
<li>Gaining support or influencing colleagues is the mantra adopted by many a successful Business Leaders.</li>
<li>Nobody expects a group of ten intelligent, assertive people, all with different points of view on a controversial subject to actually achieve a consensus. But what matters is &#8220;Did you make attempts to build a consensus?&#8221;</li>
<li>The reason why an attempt to build a consensus is important is because in most work situations you will have to work with people in a team, accept joint responsibilities and take decisions as a group.</li>
<li>You must demonstrate the fact that you are capable and inclined to work as part of a team.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Objective </strong><strong>of a Group Discussion (GD)</strong></span></p>
<p>While the written exam tests the <a title="Focus on Quantitative &amp; DI for MBA" href="http://www.htcampus.com/article/cat-2011-focus-quantitative-di-709/" target="_blank">quantitative</a>, reasoning and <a title="CAT Verbal Ability …The last mile" href="http://www.htcampus.com/article/cat-verbal-ability-last-mile-161/" target="_blank">verbal</a> skills of an applicant, that’s not all that a future manager should excel in. In fact, that is just the start. A successful manager should not just be good with his quota of work, but s/he is also expected to contribute as part of a team. And, that’s what GDs aim to test.</p>
<p>GD&#8217;s are conducted to test managerial attributes like interpersonal skills, leadership, analytical and rational thinking, knowledge and personality traits.</p>
<p>It is a way through which the B-School panel measures the calibre of the candidate on parameters like content and knowledge, rational thought process, communication skills, group behaviour and leadership skills. Look at GD&#8217;s as steps up a ladder to prepare for MBA.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Types of Group Discussions</span><br />
</strong><br />
Not all GD&#8217;s are the same. B-schools use several types to test applicants. While there are some GD&#8217;s that test the knowledge of a candidate on a topical issue, others are designed to test the ‘lateral thinking’ of the candidate.</p>
<p>Another type of GD comes in the form of a short ‘case-study’ where applicants are asked to analyse a situation and frame responses. Yet another type of a GD is a ‘group exercise’.</p>
<p>GDs can be classified into three types: factual, abstract, and case study. While factual ones are based on contemporary but controversial topics, abstract topics involve lateral thinking and unconventional perspectives.</p>
<p>Topics can either be knowledge intensive or non-knowledge intensive. Knowledge-intensive topics are based on areas like the economy and its sectors like IT or telecom, society, politics, sports or media. Non-knowledge intensive topics can either be ‘concrete topics’ (like ‘greed is good’), while ‘abstract topics’ can be totally open-ended like ‘Deep Blue is not blue enough’.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>How to Prepare for a Group Discussion </strong></span></p>
<p>So, how should you prepare for the GD? Experts opine that you should work on developing your knowledge base, while at the same time focussing on improving your communication. Some specific lessons on managing yourself during the GD are important too. There are small tricks and tips that can improve your group discussion.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Tips &amp; Tricks for a Successful Group Discussion</strong><strong></strong></span></p>
<p>The first step in your quest to do well in a GD is to improve your knowledge quotient. Read, watch, listen! Read newspapers and magazines on current issues, especially year-end issues that capture highlights of the year gone by. Also, watch and listen to the news and current affair programmes on news channels. Candidates must keep abreast of contemporary issues with help of the media.</p>
<p>There are some group discussion topics of perennial interest.</p>
<p>For <a title="Economics Course" href="http://www.htcampus.com/category/banking-finance-accounting/economics/" target="_blank">economics</a>-related topics, read fundamental concepts like FDI, stock markets, liberalisation, employment scenario, capital convertibility, rupee vs dollar, inflation, export-import, socialists vs capitalists etc.</p>
<p>For sector-based topics, start by making a one-or-two page note on important sectors like <a title="IT Management" href="http://www.htcampus.com/category/mba-business-management/information-technology-management/" target="_blank">IT</a>, ITES, <a title="Banking Course India" href="http://www.htcampus.com/category/banking-finance-accounting/banking/" target="_blank">banking</a>,<a title="Insurance courses India" href="http://www.htcampus.com/category/banking-finance-accounting/insurance-actuary/" target="_blank"> insurance</a>, <a title="Retail Management" href="http://www.htcampus.com/category/mba-business-management/retail-management/" target="_blank">retail</a>, telecom, healthcare, agriculture etc. Find out about the developments in last year and prospects in the coming ones.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Express Yourself </strong><strong>During a Group Discussion</strong></span></p>
<p>Knowledge itself is not enough. The next step is to improve your ability to express yourself. You can practice speaking in a GD scenario by forming a discussion group that meets every day and take up a topic for discussion. GD or MBA discussions, as it is also known as, can be your sure shot at getting into a good B school. So, don&#8217;t take it easily. Practice ease of expression because clarity, brevity and word choice are keenly observed by evaluators.</p>

We thought a quick, easy to read set of notes would be more helpful so here it is&#8230;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff6600;">Remember…</span></h2>
<p>1)BE ON TIME!<br />
2)Maintain eye contact with the person or people who are interviewing you.<br />
3)Be positive, avoid negatives. Don’t talk-down your past employers or coworkers.<br />
4)Try to connect your responses to the company you are interviewing with. Use stories that are relevant to your desired position.<br />
5)Silence your cell phone. Double check just before the interview. It’s important.<br />
6)Bring extra copies of your resume.<br />
7)Bring something to take notes (note pad or steno pad).<br />
8)Know something about the company. Be familiar with the mission statement &amp; corporate values. Be familiar with the history of the company &amp; any major events such as mergers or take-over’s.<br />
9)Interviews can be a stressful experience. Don’t rub your chin, twirl your hair, or anything else along those lines. It makes you look nervous and unsure of yourself.<br />
10)Be prepared to talk about your accomplishments. Review them and be confident about the details.<br />
11)Think of one or two questions to ask at the end of the interview. It shows interest and that you care.<br />
12)Know that if you have a facebook page, My Space page or Blog, the interviewer has probably read them. Going on a job hunt and having the worst parts of your life on display is not good.<br />
13)Prepare and practice. Review the job qualifications and think of relevant examples of your work that indicate you have the qualifications the employer is looking for. Once you’ve done that, practice your responses with a friend, family member or in front of a mirror.<br />
14)Provide clear, concise responses to the interview questions. Don’t ramble. No “ahs” and “ums.”<br />
15)Most employers want to learn about your accomplishments in one or more of the following areas:<br />
a.Working with others<br />
b.Developing new ideas, products &amp; procedures.<br />
c.Solving important problems<br />
d.Building &amp; leading teams<br />
e.Using sophisticated knowledge &amp; skills</p>
